<!--
  The Week window's pane while no run is open (board Main, `glance`): the
  admin "at a glance" pane (`week/Glance.svelte`, `.week-glance`) for one
  member: their next run with its art, countdown and party, then Needs you
  (answers they owe, either week), with In / Maybe / Out for the first one
  so it can be answered here. "Ask for a change…" opens the request form;
  the calendar feed is drawn as the board draws it, marked "coming soon".
