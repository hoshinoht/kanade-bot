//! The delivery journal port: every outbound post is claimed durably before

//! Lifecycle: [`DeliveryJournal::claim`] records an `intent`; the executor
//! sends, then [`bind`](DeliveryJournal::bind)s the receipt, or marks the
//! attempt `indeterminate` when the outcome is unknown, or retires it when
//! Discord definitely rejected it. Unresolved attempts keep their targets
//! held, so a restart never resends them. Timestamps are always passed in.
