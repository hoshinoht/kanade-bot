//! The rescan port the admin API submits through. Submitting only queues a
//! job; the runner reads channels in its own task, so no request waits on a
//! scan. [`RescanService`] adapts the extractor's [`Rescans`] queue; the
//! API's `Idempotency-Key` replays are stored rows (scope `rescan`), and
//! [`RescanDesk`] serialises keyed submits and cancels.
