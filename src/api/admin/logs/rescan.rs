//! Rescan targets and jobs. `POST` only queues a job through the rescan port
//! (the runner reads in its own task) and answers with it; `GET` polls it;
//! `DELETE` cancels it and is safe to repeat. `POST` and `DELETE` honour
//! `Idempotency-Key` (stored replays, scope `rescan`): a replay answers the
//! recorded job's current state, the same key with another request is
//! `422 idempotency_mismatch`.
