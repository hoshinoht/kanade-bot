//! The single-shard event loop.
//!
//! Reconnects and backoff are Twilight's: polling a [`Shard`] reconnects on
//! its own (exponential, 2^attempt seconds) and resumes where Discord allows.
//! The stream ends only after a fatal close (e.g. invalid token or disallowed
//! intents), which the runner reports as [`RunExit::Closed`] with the code of
//! the close frame that preceded it.
//!
//! Handler contract: [`EventHandler::handle`] runs inline in this loop, so it
//! must be short and must not await Discord transport calls; spawn that work
//! (see `commands::spawn_interaction`) so the shard keeps being polled.
