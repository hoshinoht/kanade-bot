//! Rescan and backfill jobs (v4 `bot/agent/rescan.py` and
//! `Pipeline.rescan_window`): requests queue, one job runs at a time, its
//! channels one after another, and each channel's window is backfilled,
//! cut into conversations, read at the backlog's fixed pace and proposed
//! once. Jobs persist in `rescan_jobs`; cancellation lands between bursts.
