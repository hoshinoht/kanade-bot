//! One question's delivery (`docs/notes/chat-orchestration.md`, "Delivery"):
//! a silent staging placeholder replying to the question, typing while the
//! answer runs, then the answer edited into the placeholder (part 1) and
//! posted as silent continuations. State lives in memory only; the
//! [`DeliveryRecord`] is shared with the question's `Held` guard so an abort
//! sees what was delivered.
//!
//! Effects run in this task, one at a time (the placeholder's withdrawal runs
//! beside the still-running answer). A started effect is awaited to its
//! outcome; deletion and shutdown are observed only between effects. Retries:
//! a create that was never sent is retried once and an ambiguous create is
//! never replayed; an edit or delete gets at most one identical retry.
